            Like most website operators, WrestlingWorld collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
            web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
            site, and the date and time of each visitor request. WrestlingWorld’s purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how WrestlingWorld’s visitors use its website. From time to
            time, WrestlingWorld may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
            publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
          </p>
          <p>
            WrestlingWorld also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
            addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.wrestlingworld.co blog posts.
            WrestlingWorld only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it
            uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

          <H2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</H2>
          <p>
            Certain visitors to WrestlingWorld’s website choose to interact with WrestlingWorld in ways that require
            WrestlingWorld to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
            WrestlingWorld gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up
            for a newsletter at https://www.wrestlingworld.co to provide a username and email address.
